Background
==
Monocular, a business-to-business software as service application, provides its customers custom data derived from the interactions between their websites and users. This data allows the customer to make improvements to a website, resulting in a better user experience and potential for an improved bottom line.

The application is easy to use, requiring a simple JavaScript drop-in to allow the customer to begin tracking users. Monocular utilizes a REST API to receive data from the customerâ€™s website, and stores it within a database on a secure server. This data becomes available to the customer using the web application.

The Stack
==
Monocular is built with Ruby on Rails and is currently hosted on Heroku at [monocular.herokuapp.com](monocular.herokuapp.com). Monocular uses PostgreSQL as a database. However, it is trivial to configure Monocular to use your preferred database, for more info visit this [link](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database).
